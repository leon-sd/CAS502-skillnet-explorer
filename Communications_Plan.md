# Collaboration and Communication Plan

We will coordinate primarily through Slack and GitHub. Each week we will do one short sync (20–30 
minutes) to decide priorities, confirm who is implementing what, and identify any blockers. We will track 
work using GitHub Issues (one issue per feature/subtask) and keep progress visible using short 
checklists inside each issue. Work will be integrated through small commits and pull requests so both 
team members can review changes before merging.
