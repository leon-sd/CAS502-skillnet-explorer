# Anticipated Challenges

Technical challenges include making sure the data filtering logic is correct (using the right scale, 
applying thresholds consistently, handling missing values safely) while also keeping the script’s runtime 
reasonable. Process-wise, the main risk is maintaining discipline with small, clear commits, well-defined 
issues, and reproducible runs while learning the tooling (git/GitHub and Python environments) in 
parallel. Finally, in terms of skills and capacity, because I’m still a beginner, it’s hard to estimate effort for 
“nice-to-have” features up front, so some items may need to be re-prioritized or simplified based on time 
and implementation difficulty. Name-based search introduces ambiguity (synonyms, partial matches, 
and similar skill names), so we may need a simple disambiguation step , like a “did you mean…” 
suggestions/list.
